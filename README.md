<b>Areas to Further this Project</b>
_Option 1_
* Compile macroeconomic data over similar time period 
* Complete an analysis on if / how macroeconomic factors are impacting ad revenue across channels
_Option 2_
* Define what is being competed for 
>* Ex: Social media, streaming platforms for video & audio compete for monetizing a usersâ€™ u time
* Compile data to analyze trends and determine if there is alignment with what we see across the ad revenue for the different segments/companies
_Option 3_
* Dive into how traditional companies (linear & offline) are transitioning to remain relevant 
>* What tools are they using? How may it help others in parallel industries and smaller competitors?
>* Ex: New York Times: print vs digital ads - digital is already 61% of ad revenue. What is NYT offering?
>>* Can lead to comparison of different digital offerings & identification of core drivers/systems for displaying relevant ads.
